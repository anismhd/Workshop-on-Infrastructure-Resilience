# Workshop-on-Infrastructure-Resilience

## Objective
The objective of this hands-on session is to introduce the iRe-CoDeS framework for resilience studies, along with the pyrecodes library for its implementation. The session will include two exercises.

## Softwares and Libraries
The handown section will be carried out in CC of IITB. The softwares and libraries which would be used in the session will be installed in the CC computers. For individuals who are planning to use their personal laptop, following softwares or libraries may be installed

1. [pyrecodes](https://nikolablagojevic.github.io/pyrecodes/html/usage/what_is_pyrecodes.html) - _pyrecodes_ is an open-source Python library for regional disaster recovery simulation and disaster resilience assessment of the built environment with the primary goal to respond to this pressing need. pyrecodes is based on the iRe-CoDeS framework developed in the research group of Professor Božidar Stojadinović at the Chair of Structural Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering at ETH Zurich, Switzerland.
2. [Hazus or DesignSafe R2D](https://www.fema.gov/flood-maps/products-tools/hazus) - [Optional] FEMA’s Hazus Program provides standardized tools and data for estimating risk from earthquakes, floods, tsunamis, and hurricanes. Hazus models combine expertise from many disciplines to create actionable risk information that increases community resilience.
3. [QGIS](https://qgis.org/download/) - [Optional] A free and open-source desktop Geographical Information System (GIS) software.

# Prerequisite
A basic understanding of Python is essential for this session. Participants are encouraged to review the (basic Python training materials)(https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/)  beforehand.
