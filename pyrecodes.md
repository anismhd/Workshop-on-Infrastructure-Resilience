# Brief Description of pyrecodes
## General
iRe-CoDeS (Resilience-Compositional Demand/Supply) is bottom-up quantitative resilience assessment methodology proposed by \cite{pyrecodes} is described in detail.
The approach in applicable to systems for __finite a time period__ following a __single disaster__, and assesses resilience while considering the inter dependencies among its subsystems. __pyrecodes__ an open-source python implementation of the iRe-CoDeS framework.

In iRe-CoDeS framework resilience is quantifies the resilience of a system concerning a specific resource or service by contrasting the supply, demand, and consumption of the considered resource or service within the system during the resilience assessment interval. When the system's demand cannot be met by the available supply, a __Lack of Resilience (LoR)__ occurs.
